Architecture:
Correlation architecture:
   - Thread out on each (src,dst) pair for speed purposes
   - Join on all threads (after emails have been sent out), regardless of
     whether outages passed filters
   - Have a merging module that takes all joined threads and decideds which to
     merge


Pruning architecture:
   - For reverse path failures, 


Updates:
   - Reverse path isolation run for bidirectional outages as well. We'll see
     if the results differ later on
   - TRs dumped to DB
   - Simple initialization/pruning set up. Made it easy to add more
     suspect set initializers and pruners (just pass a block)
   - Threading architecture set up
   - Blocked on Ethan's PL-PL traceroutes, so I think I might start working on
     operator verification (setting up a website, etc.)
