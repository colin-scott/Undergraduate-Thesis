What I want to add to the logs:
   - a boolean flag for whether the outage passed filtering heuristcs
   - how many hops from the src/dest the failure was


How to tell if the problem was caused by a forward path change:
 (see: pl1.6test.edu.cn_211.160.161.1_20113301998.jpg)
'- if hops beyond the suspected problem are still pingable. Especially if
   there is a AS transition right after the suspected problem

Finding the reverse path failure suspect:
   - If there is both a tr and a spoofed tr, it's where the two diverge
   - If only a spoofed tr, it's the last pingable hop


There seem to be a fair number of cases where the spoofedtr differs 
from the normal tr. Path change while measurements were taken?
Destination-based routing assumption broken?
see: (planetlab1.nvlab.org_122.203.251.1_2011227191747.jpg)
Is the suspect then the router where the path diverges?

In general, the reverse path failures seem pretty tough to pin down!

Maybe this process isn't automatable for reverse path failures... 
implement a system to allow humans to annotate the failures post-hoc?
