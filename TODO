- Fix pptasks ping in suspect_set_processors. HYPOTHESIS: merging outages in
  up to three ways simulaneously => concurrent + redundant pings to the same
  nodes
- Fix poisoner logging
- Implement unpoison

There have been some bizzare cases where the source doesn't get any replies
back from normal tr or non-revtr pings...
To look into it, run:
   - tcpdump on a handful of nodes
   - add a ping to crash.cs.washington.edu

Why does the controller sometimes stop writing to the log?

Not that many outages are passing the filtering heuristics. Could be
thrashing, could be that the heuristics are too stringent. Look into it?

How to tell if the problem was caused by a forward path change:
 (see: pl1.6test.edu.cn_211.160.161.1_20113301998.jpg)

   - if hops beyond the suspected problem are still pingable. Especially if
     there is a AS transition right after the suspected problem

Finding the reverse path failure suspect:
   - If there is both a tr and a spoofed tr, it's where the two diverge
   - If only a spoofed tr, it's the last /pingable/ hop
   - If only a revtr

There seem to be a fair number of cases where the spoofedtr differs 
from the normal tr. Path change while measurements were taken?
Destination-based routing assumption broken?
see: (planetlab1.nvlab.org_122.203.251.1_2011227191747.jpg)
Is the suspect then the router where the path diverges?

In general, the reverse path failures seem pretty tough to pin down!
  - Send out an outline of the algorithm for the three pieces of data:
      * who is adjacent to the failure 
      * (if possible) whether the failure is on a new or old path
      * whether the historical forward/reverse paths are working
  - Find cases where we had complete information, yet couldn't pinpoint the
    failure
  - Find cases where we had complete information, and could pinpoint failure,
    just to demonstrate the algorithm
  - Find cases where we didn't have complete information, and identify what
    info would have helped

Fix Harsha's tool to always go up to ttl 30?
